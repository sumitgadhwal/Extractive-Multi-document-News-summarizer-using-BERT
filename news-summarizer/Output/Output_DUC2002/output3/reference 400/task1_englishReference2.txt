 The Irish Republican Army claimed 
responsibility for a huge explosion Friday that reduced a three-story military 
barracks on the southeast coast of England to rubble, killing 10 people and 
injuring 22, eight seriously. 

The IRA bombing that killed 10 men and 
blew apart a building at the Royal Marines Music School outraged Britons and 
stirred recriminations over safety standards at the school. 

 A huge explosion in a barracks staff 
room Friday morning leveled the three-story building as bandsmen took a coffee 
break between practice sessions on the school's parade ground. 

One of the bands had just stopped 
playing on the parade ground, said a ministry spokesman, speaking anonymously in 
keeping with British custom. 

 Neighbors were breakfasting, heading 
to work or asleep in bed when an explosion at a military barracks turned their 
homes to rubble and they were confronted with the sight of bodies being carried 
away. 

 Twelve of the 22 people injured were 
hospitalized, eight of them in serious condition, police said. 

 Dozens of homes near the school were 
damaged, including four that were destroyed. 

 Jean Cleatheroe, whose son Andrew was 
killed, joined local residents and opposition politicians in denouncing the use 
of private security firms to protect the music school and 29 other military 
establishments in Britain. 

 King defended the use of private 
security firms hired to guard the Deal school and 29 other ``low-risk'' military 
installations in Britain. 

 A statement telephoned to Ireland 
International, a Dublin news agency, said ``we have visited the Royal Marines in 
Kent'' in response to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's visit to Northern 
Ireland nine days ago. 

It was an apparent reference to her 
speech praising the locally recruited Ulster Defense Regiment as ``a very, very 
brave group of men'' who have lost 179 members in IRA attacks since 1970. 

 British military installations are a 
frequent bombing target of the Irish Republican Army in its campaign to rid 
Northern Ireland of British rule, but today's explosion in the coastal town 70 
miles southeast of London was the worst IRA attack on the British mainland in 
more than seven years. 

Military targets on the British 
mainland have been attacked several times by the Irish Republican Army in the 
past year as part of its campaign to rid Northern Ireland of British rule. 

 The authorities have been on high 
alert, expecting IRA attacks in connection with last month's 20th anniversary of 
the introduction of British troops into Northern Ireland.
