 An explosion today flattened 
a military barracks and tore through nearby homes, killing 11 people 
and injuring 22, police said. 

 The blast occurred at at 8:26 
a.m. in a lounge in the barracks near Deal, about 70 miles southeast of 
London, the Defense Ministry said. 

 The Defense Ministry said 
seven were missing. 

Dozens of homes near the 
school were damaged, including four that were destroyed. 

The IRA claimed responsibility 
for the blast. 

A statement telephoned to Ireland 
International, a Dublin news agency, said ``we have visited the Royal Marines in Kent'' in 
response to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's visit to Northern Ireland nine days 
ago. 

 Defense Secretary Tom King, 
inspecting the wreckage, said: ``It is not yet absolutely confirmed that it is a bomb, but all 
the evidence is quite clearly that this is an IRA atrocity''. 

Scotland Yard said a forensic team 
from its anti-terrorist squad had been called in to help investigate. 

 Police investigating the attack were 
searching a nearby house that had been rented briefly by three men with Irish 
accents. 

 Raymond Kendall, the secretary-
general of the international police organization Interpol, pledged the organization's full 
support in the hunt for those who blew up the school. 

 The authorities have been on high 
alert, expecting IRA attacks in connection with last month's 20th anniversary of the 
introduction of British troops into Northern Ireland. 

Friday's attack was the worst on the 
mainland since the virtually simultaneous bombings of July, 1982, directed at ceremonial 
military units in London's Hyde Park and Regent's Park. 

Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said 
Monday the Irish Republican Army members who blew up the Royal Marines School of 
Music and killed 10 bandsmen last week are ``monsters'' who will be found and 
punished. 

 Prime Minister Charles Haughey of 
Ireland condemned the attack and sent Mrs. Thatcher a message of sympathy at ``this 
outrage ... 

Residents of the area adjoining the 
Marines school said Friday that despite government calls for stepped-up public alertness 
against terrorists, security at the school had eased noticeably. 

The Royal Marines Music School is 
one of 30 military establishments in Britain that use private security firms, Defense 
Ministry figures show. 

 King defended the use of private 
security firms hired to guard the Deal school and 29 other ``low-risk'' military 
installations in Britain. 

King said the private firms will 
remain.
