 Clarence Thomas completed 
five grueling days of Senate questioning Monday, apparently well on his 
way to becoming the second black justice in the history of the Supreme 
Court. 
 The committee will continue 
to hear testimony for and against Thomas at least through the end of 
the week, but the outcome does not seem to be in doubt. 
  Supreme Court nominee 
Clarence Thomas told the Senate Judiciary Committee today it is 
"irrelevant" whether he holds any personal opinion on abortion, 
spurring new frustration among the committee's Democrats. 
  Frustrated Democrats on the 
Senate Judiciary Committee say Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas is 
an evasive witness, but no groundswell of opposition to his 
confirmation seems to be emerging. 
  Asked several times by Sen. 
Herb Kohl, D-Wis. 
  , about women's right to 
end their pregnancies, Thomas said, "Whether or not I have a view is 
irrelevant."; President Bush, asked at a news conference whether 
Thomas' claim not to have an opinion on abortion is credible, answered, 
"That's a question for the Senate to decide."; "He's handling himself 
very well," the president said. 
 (check) About 300 black 
pastors, representing congregations totaling more than 1 million 
churchgoers in 30 states, held a rally on the steps of the Supreme 
Court and then lobbied their senators to support confirmation of 
President Bush's Supreme Court nominee.

of the Thomas confirmation issue, the National Abortion Rights Action 
League reported that senators had begun to receive the first of 500,000 
anti-Thomas post cards the group has provided to the constituents of 
targeted lawmakers whose votes against Thomas' confirmation are 
regarded as critical. 
  And Simon said Thomas' 
performance thus far "has neither helped him nor hurt him."; Specter 
blamed fellow committee members more than Thomas in concluding, "We 
really haven't moved very far in the process."; Thomas, a black federal 
appeals judge, was picked by President Bush to replace the retiring 
Thurgood Marshall, the high court's only black justice.

  Virginia Thomas is a soft-
spoken, hard-working daughter of the heartland. 
  A brainy Omaha, Neb. 
 , lawyer who has scaled the 
sheer cliffs of professional Washington. 
  The fact that she is white 
has drawn criticism from some blacks who see the marriage as evidence 
that Clarence Thomas has rejected his roots.
