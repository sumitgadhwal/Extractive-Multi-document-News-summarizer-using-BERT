SENATE QUESTIONING OF THOMAS ENDS 
BUSH NOMINEE APPEARS HEADED FOR HIGH COURT  Clarence Thomas completed five 
grueling days of Senate questioning Monday, apparently well on his way to 
becoming the second black justice in the history of the Supreme Court.   Several committee members said they 
expected the committee to recommend, by a 10-4 or 9-5 vote, that the Senate 
confirm Thomas.   Although Thomas appeared to back 
away from comments made in past speeches or articles, he told the committee, "My 
view is that I have been consistent."; Thomas' opponents believe Republicans 
Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, Orrin Hatch of Utah, Charles Grassley of Iowa, 
Alan Simpson of Wyoming and Hank Brown of Colorado are solid Thomas backers.  But they hope Sens.   Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.  , and Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, 
will be joined by the three swing-vote senators and Biden, Leahy, Simon and Kohl 
in voting against the nominee.  They accused him of being evasive 
and of disavowing many controversial statements he made while an official of the 
Reagan and Bush administrations.   They see a woman with strong 
opinions on issues that are bound to come before the court.   Some women's-rights activists are 
upset by her lobbying against such issues as comparable-worth legislation.   Some religious-rights groups are 
troubled by her anti-cult activities in light of her former involvement with 
Lifespring, a motivational group.  The fact that she is white has drawn 
criticism from some blacks who see the marriage as evidence that Clarence Thomas 
has rejected his roots.   True equality is achieved by holding 
everyone to the same standard, they believe.   Clarence Thomas advocates a 
colorblind society, and his marriage may be an example of that philosophy.   While the 14-member Senate Judiciary 
Committee presses Clarence Thomas to explain his qualifications for the Supreme 
Court, all 100 senators are under mounting pressure to explain their views of 
the judge.
