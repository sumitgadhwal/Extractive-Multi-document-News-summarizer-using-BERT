  Thousands of Americans piled into 
cars and buses with dogs, cats and duffel bags and left Clark Air Base today after 
scientists warned that the eruption of a nearby volcano could turn catastrophic. 
  The decision to evacuate one 
of the largest overseas U.S. military bases was made early today after 
searing gases, ash and rock shot out of 4,795-foot Mount Pinatubo on 
Sunday at speeds of up to 60 mph . 
  The Americans who fled 
Clark with a few belongings Monday moved in with sailors and their 
families at Subic Bay naval base, 50 miles to the southwest. 
  But officials issued no 
general evacuation order for Angeles, even though the city is next to 
Clark Air Base. 
  U.S. geologists advising 
the Philippine government said most of Angeles was not at risk, 
apparently basing their assessment on earth samples indicating that 
earlier eruptions had reached the area on which Clark now stands but 
had spared what is now Angeles. 
  Friday, eight thunderous 
explosions shot a cloud of ash and steam nearly 19 miles high. 
  Friday's eruptions hurled 
ash over Clark, 10 miles east of the volcano, and Subic, 25 miles 
southwest, where the Clark personnel had been temporarily housed. 
  President Corazon Aquino 
helicoptered to refugee centers near Angeles briefly before returning 
to Manila for an Independence Day rally and parade at Luneta Park. 
 She authorized the release 
of $1.42 million for relief efforts. 
  U.S. officials have refused 
to say whether nuclear weapons are stored at Clark, but they denied 
news reports suggesting a radiation danger if weapons depots on the 
base were hit by molten rock. 
  At least four people have 
died, 24 have been hurt and four have been listed as missing since 
Pinatubo began erupting Sunday, after lying dormant for six centuries, 
officials said. 
 About 84,000 people, 
including Americans, have been evacuated. 
  Friday's eruptions hurled 
ash over Clark, 10 miles east of the volcano, and Subic, 25 miles 
southwest, where the Clark personnel had been temporarily housed. 
  Raymundo Punongbayan, 
director of the Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology, 
said Friday's blasts were part of a single eruption, the largest since 
Mount Pinatubo awoke Sunday from its 600-year slumber. 
  Punongbayan said Mount 
Pinatubo could remain active for years if it follows the pattern of 
similar Philippine volcanoes. 
  That would leave Clark 
unusable .
