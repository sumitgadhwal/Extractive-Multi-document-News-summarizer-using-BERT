 Ousted East German leader Erich 
Honecker, who is expected to be indicted for high treason, was arrested Monday 
morning upon release from a hospital and taken to prison, the official news 
agency ADN said.   The news agency 
said the 77-year-old Honecker was arrested after being released from East 
Berlin's Charite hospital, where he had undergone surgery for a malignant kidney 
tumor.  
 Honecker, the aging hard-
line Stalinist leader who ruled East Germany for 18 years until his ouster on 
Oct. 18, had previously been declared too ill to withstand imprisonment.   
 Honecker was immediately taken to East 
Berlin's Rummelsburg prison, the brief dispatch said. 
 Honecker joins other members of his ousted Politburo already 
in prison awaiting trial.  
 Earlier 
this month, East German prosecutors said Honecker and former state security 
chief Erich Mielke would be charged with treason and corruption charges for 
misuse of their positions and state funds.  
 He is under investigation on allegations of abuse of power, 
corruption, harboring terrorists and issuing shoot-to-kill orders to prevent 
East Germans from escaping to West Germany when he served as the country's 
leader.  
Honecker, 78, was jailed 
for one day in January. 
 Honecker 
has been staying at a Soviet military hospital outside East Berlin. 
 A ranking member of Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl's party demanded the Soviet Union hand over Erich Honecker, who is wanted 
by German authorities on manslaughter charges, a newspaper reported on 
Saturday.  
Federal lawmaker Johannes 
Gerster said refusal to turn over the deposed East German leader for trial could 
``burden'' Bonn and Moscow's ``outstanding relations,'' the Neue Osnabruecker 
Zeitung newspaper reported. 
 Honecker has denied all charges against him, including that he was personally 
responsible for the estimated 200 people who died trying to escape his 
repressive government.  
Mikhail Gorbachev urged all sides Tuesday to take their time in deciding the fate of 
Erich Honecker, as the fugitive former East German leader spent a seventh day of 
refuge inside the Chilean Embassy. 
 Last week Russia abruptly ordered Honecker to leave the country or 
face expulsion.
