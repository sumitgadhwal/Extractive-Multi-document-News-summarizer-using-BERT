 Ousted East German leader 
Erich Honecker, who is expected to be indicted for high treason, was 
arrested Monday morning upon release from a hospital and taken to 
prison, the official news agency ADN said. 
 The news agency said the 77-
year-old Honecker was arrested after being released from East Berlin's 
Charite hospital, where he had undergone surgery for a malignant kidney 
tumor. 
 Earlier this month, East 
German prosecutors said Honecker and former state security chief Erich 
Mielke would be charged with treason and corruption charges for misuse 
of their positions and state funds. 
 East Germany authorities on 
Friday interrogated former Communist leader Erich Honecker about his 
role in the killings of people who tried to flee the country. 
 More than 200 people were shot 
to death or killed by land mines as they tried to escape from East 
Germany's Communist rule. 
 The government announced in 
June that Honecker, Mielke and several border guards would be 
investigated on possible murder charges in connection with those 
deaths. 
 Honecker, 77 and in failing 
health, and several other members of his ousted regime already have 
been charged with corruption and abuse of power. 
 The murder charge could put 
Honecker behind bars for life, but his poor health makes prosecution 
questionable. 
 Ousted East German leader 
Erich Honecker will not stand trial in East Germany as long as the 
formerly Communist country exists, a West German newspaper 
reported. 
 Honecker, 78, was ousted as 
East Germany's leader on Oct. 18, paving the way for the country's 
first freely elected government in March. 
Honecker has denied all 
charges against him, including that he was personally responsible for 
the estimated 200 people who died trying to escape his repressive 
government. 
 He has taken refuge at a 
Soviet military hospital in Beelitz, outside Berlin. 
Last week Russia abruptly 
ordered Honecker to leave the country or face expulsion. 
 Mikhail Gorbachev urged all 
sides Tuesday to take their time in deciding the fate of Erich 
Honecker, as the fugitive former East German leader spent a seventh day 
of refuge inside the Chilean Embassy. 
 BFN [Text] Berlin -- Erich 
Honecker, the former GDR head of state, died at his house in Santiago, 
Chile on Sunday morning [29 May], according to his lawyer. 
 After being released from 
prison in 1993, Honecker had traveled to Santiago to join his daughter, 
who is married to a Chilean.
