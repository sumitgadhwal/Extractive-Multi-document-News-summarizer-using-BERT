  At least 109 people have been killed 
and more than 800,000 left homeless since Gilbert ripped through the Caribbean 
with 175 mph wind earlier this week, then crossed the Yucatan Peninsula and Gulf 
of Mexico before slamming into northeastern Mexico.   Tropical Storm Gilbert formed in the 
eastern Caribbean and strengthened into a hurricane Saturday night.  Forecasters said the hurricane was 
gaining strength as it passed over the ocean and would dump heavy rain on the 
Dominican Republic and Haiti as it moved south of Hispaniola, the Caribbean 
island they share, and headed west.   Gilbert, an ``extremely dangerous 
hurricane'' and one of the strongest storms in history, roared toward Mexico's 
Yucatan Peninsula Tuesday with 175 mph winds after battering the Dominican 
Republic, Jamaica and the tiny Cayman Islands.   The center said Hurricane Gilbert was 
the most intense storm on record in terms of barometric pressure.  The hurricane, traveling westward 
across the Caribbean Sea, was upgraded Tuesday to a Category 5, the strongest 
and deadliest type of hurricane.  Gilbert is one of only three Category 
5 storms in the hemisphere since weather officials began keeping detailed 
records.   hurricane is responsible for 
the worst natural disaster in U.S. history, however.   Hurricane Gilbert battered the resorts 
of the Yucatan Peninsula today with 160 mph winds and torrential rains. The most intense hurricane on record 
surged toward Texas today after battering the Yucatan Peninsula with 160 mph 
winds, leveling slums, pummeling posh resorts and forcing tens of thousands to 
flee.  Hurricane Gilbert, which has left 
nearly one in four Jamaicans homeless, slackened somewhat as it swirled over 
land, but the storm was beginning to gain strength over open water as it moved 
toward the U.S. Gulf Coast with sustained winds of 120 mph.  Thousands of coastal residents from 
Mexico to Louisiana fled to higher ground Thursday as fierce Hurricane Gilbert 
sent the first of its storms against Texas after thrashing the Yucatan 
Peninsula.   Hurricane Gilbert weakened to a 
tropical storm as it blustered northwestward today but it threw tornadoes and 
sheets of rain at thousands of shuttered evacuees along the Texas-Mexico 
border.   Rains from Hurricane Gilbert sent a 
river raging over its banks in Monterrey, sweeping at least 10 policemen to 
their deaths and overturning buses loaded with evacuees from Matamoros, police 
said today.
