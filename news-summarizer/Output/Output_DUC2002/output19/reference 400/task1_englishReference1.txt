 Gilbert, an ``extremely 
dangerous hurricane'' and one of the strongest storms in history, 
roared toward Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula Tuesday with 175 mph winds 
after battering the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and the tiny Cayman 
Islands. 
  With the winds of Hurricane 
Gilbert clocked at 175 miles per hour, U.S. weather officials called 
Gilbert the most intense hurricane ever recorded in the Western 
Hemisphere. 
  Mark Zimmer, a meterologist 
at the National Hurricane Center, reported an Air Force reconnaissance 
plane measured the barometric pressure at Gilbert's center at 26.13 
inches at 5:52 p.m. EDT on Tuesday. 
  With tropical storm force 
winds extending 250 miles north and 200 miles south of the hurricane's 
center, Gilbert also was one of the largest. 
 Gilbert is one of only three 
Category 5 storms in the hemisphere since weather officials began 
keeping detailed records. 
  The others were the 1935 
Labor Day hurricane and Hurricane Camille, which bulldozed the 
Mississippi Coast with 172 mph winds and a 28-foot wave in 1969, 
leaving $1.4 billion in damage and 256 dead. 
  Hurricane Gilbert battered 
the resorts of the Yucatan Peninsula today with 160 mph winds and 
torrential rains. 
 The ministry said the storm 
seriously damaged the luxury hotel zone in the resort of Cancun and 
destroyed about a quarter of the homes on the nearby island of 
Cozumel. 
 The most intense hurricane on 
record surged toward Texas today after battering the Yucatan Peninsula 
with 160 mph winds, leveling slums, pummeling posh resorts and forcing 
tens of thousands to flee.   The storm, spawned Saturday 
southeast of Puerto Rico, appeared to have hit Jamaica the hardest. 
  That island nation's prime 
minister, Edward Seaga, said Wednesday that it destroyed about 100,000 
of Jamaica's 500,000 homes. 
  The weather service issued a 
hurricane warning for Mexico's northern coast and the southern half of 
the 370-mile Texas coast from Brownsville to Port O'Connor, including 
250,000-resident Corpus Christi. 
  Hurricane Gilbert weakened to 
a tropical storm as it blustered northwestward today but it threw 
tornadoes and sheets of rain at thousands of shuttered evacuees along 
the Texas-Mexico border. 
  Gilbert's remnants should 
bring very heavy rains to Rio Grande valley before heading north up the 
Mississippi River Valley as a ``huge rain-making machine,'' said Mark 
Zimmer, meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, 
Fla. 
 Rains from Hurricane Gilbert 
sent a river raging over its banks in Monterrey, sweeping at least 10 
policemen to their deaths and overturning buses loaded with evacuees 
from Matamoros, police said today.
