 Leonard Bernstein, the Renaissance man 
of music who excelled as pianist, composer, conductor and teacher and was, as 
well, the flamboyant ringmaster of his own nonstop circus, died Sunday in his 
Manhattan apartment.   Bernstein was the first American-born 
conductor to lead a major symphony orchestra, often joining his New York 
Philharmonic in playing his own pieces, while conducting from the piano .   He etched other niches in history by 
composing the indelible "West Side Story" and teaching a generation about 
classical music via the innovative television series "Omnibus" .   "An assessment of Bernstein must 
include his talent and contribution as a teacher and popularizer of music, a 
role that has set him apart most from other performers," conductor, historian 
and Bard College President Leon Botstein wrote in Harper's in 1983 .  Bernstein, who died of lung failure 
Sunday at age 72, was buried this afternoon in private ceremonies at Greenwood 
Cemetery in Brooklyn.   Bernstein, 71, has suffered from 
severe influenza, pleurisy, and pneumonia since the beginning of the year, 
Cahill said in a statement released by Harry Kraut, Bernstein's manager.   Flags at Lincoln Center, where the New 
York Philharmonic performs, were lowered in memory of the orchestra's first 
American-born music director.   For the New York Philharmonic, it was 
supposed to be a night of Beethoven and Shostakovich.   The fates made it a night of Leonard 
Bernstein.   But this was HIS orchestra, and the 
musicians came to pay tribute to THEIR laureate conductor, who led them through 
1,244 concerts during his 47-year association with the Philharmonic.   Wednesday's midday concert at Carnegie 
Hall also came on the 90th birthday of the late composer-conductor's close 
friend, Aaron Copland.   In addition to the Leonard Bernstein 
tribute that is part of the Los Angeles Philharmonic program this weekend, other 
local orchestras are also planning special remembrances.   Laughter and tears flowed freely as 
the Broadway theatrical community said goodby Thursday to Leonard Bernstein at 
the Majestic Theater.   Recordings by Leonard Bernstein, one of 
the most documented conductors in history, will undergo expanded release 
programs following the conductor's death on Sunday, said representatives of the 
recording companies controlling the late Bernstein's catalogues .  Three movies whose scores he composed 
are also on home video:   The Leonard Bernstein Gala Birthday 
Performance is a benefit concert scheduled for the composer's 70th birthday, 
Aug. 25, to raise money for the Tanglewood Music Center, where Bernstein got his 
conducting start.
