  Leonard Bernstein, whose 70th 
birthday in August was marked with a gala at Tanglewood, returned to 
Carnegie Hall with the New York Philharmonic 45 years after he made his 
triumphant conducting debut there with the orchestra. 
  The 72-year-old maestro 
suffers from a lung tumor, emphysema and pulmonary infections and has 
been told by his doctor to stop conducting and performing on the piano, 
his spokeswoman said Tuesday. 
  Bernstein's announcement 
was met with dismay in the music world, especially at the New York 
Philharmonic, which he directed from 1958 to 1969. 
 Leonard Bernstein, the 
Renaissance man of music who excelled as pianist, composer, conductor 
and teacher and was, as well, the flamboyant ringmaster of his own 
nonstop circus, died Sunday in his Manhattan apartment. 
  Flags at Lincoln Center, 
where the New York Philharmonic performs, were lowered in memory of the 
orchestra's first American-born music director. 
  Famed for his gymnastics at 
the podium, Bernstein composed symphonies as well as movie scores and 
Broadway shows such as ``West Side Story,'' ``On the Town'' and 
``Candide''. 
 It was on television in the 
1950s and 1960s, with his "Young People's Concerts" of the Philharmonic 
and "Omnibus," that Bernstein taught the nation . 
  The television classics won 
Bernstein a coveted Peabody award . 
 Bernstein was the first 
American-born conductor to lead a major symphony orchestra, often 
joining his New York Philharmonic in playing his own pieces, while 
conducting from the piano . 
 For the New York 
Philharmonic, it was supposed to be a night of Beethoven and 
Shostakovich. 
The fates made it a night of 
Leonard Bernstein. 
 So four nights after 
Bernstein's death at age 72, Beethoven's ``Violin Concerto'' became 
Bernstein's ``Serenade for Solo Violin, String Orchestra, Harp and 
Percussion'' (1954); Shostakovich's ``Symphony No. 4'' became 
Bernstein's ``Symphony No. 1 (Jeremiah),'' written in 1942. 
 It was an extraordinary 
concert. 
 At Harvard University, 
Bernstein studied piano and composition, but developed a serious 
interest in composing only after meeting American composer Aaron 
Copland . 
 They became lifelong 
friends. 
A heavy smoker and drinker 
who partied or worked until dawn and slept until noon, he claimed he 
composed or studied scores even when surrounded by people . 
 Raising the high-brow music 
world's eyebrows, Bernstein campaigned with other celebrities for the 
civil rights of blacks in the 1960s and against the Vietnam War in the 
1970s.
