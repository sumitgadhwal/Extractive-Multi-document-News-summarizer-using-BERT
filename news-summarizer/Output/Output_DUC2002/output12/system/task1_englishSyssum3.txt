I was proud to be 
associated with him at the New York Philharmonic and the Israel Philharmonic 
Orchestra, both of which he considered family."
Bernstein was the New York Philharmonic's 25-year-old assistant
conductor on Nov. 14, 1943, when he filled in at the last minute
for an ailing Bruno Walter.

   Leonard Bernstein, whose wide-ranging talents
and flamboyant personality helped make him the first American
maestro to conquer music's international podium, was buried today
alongside his wife.

Bernstein's who was with him at the end, spoke movingly of how difficult it was 
for Bernstein to continue when illness had robbed him of his creative energy.
Bernstein was the first American-born conductor to lead a major symphony 
orchestra, often joining his New York Philharmonic in playing his own pieces, 
while conducting from the piano.
BMG also plans, according to spokesman Carl Pritzkat, the spring release of an 
early Bernstein recording as pianist -- in which he plays Copland's Piano 
Variations -- as well as other recorded documents of the young 
composer/pianist.
In 1969, he retired from the post to concentrate on composing
and was appointed the Philharmonic's laureate conductor for life.
Bernstein's announcement was met with dismay in the music world,
especially at the New York Philharmonic, which he directed from
1958 to 1969.
Bernstein was not to get his own orchestra until he took over the New York 
Philharmonic in 1957-58.
In May, he canceled plans to conduct opening night of the
Spoleto Festival in Charleston, S.C., citing ``a near brush with
pneumonia.''

young, Bernstein was given little chance of actually taking the podium.
