Famous Allied Checkpoint Dividing East 
And West Berlin Removed  Checkpoint Charlie, the Berlin Wall 
border post that symbolized the Cold War, was hoisted into history today . As a brass band played and foreign 
ministers of the four World War II allies watched, a crane lifted the 
prefabricated hut with its American, British and French flags and placed it on a 
flatbed truck to be taken to a museum .  Checkpoint Charlie went up in 1961 in 
the middle of the Friedrichstrasse boulevard after Communist East Germany 
erected the Berlin Wall to choke off a flood of refugees to the enclave of West 
Berlin .  Since East Germany overthrew its 
Communist government last fall and the German borders were opened, Checkpoint 
Charlie has become as superfluous as the crumbling Berlin Wall. With the wall being dismantled daily 
in anticipation of German unification, U.S. officials decided to remove 
Checkpoint Charlie with a grand flourish.  Secretary of State James A. Baker III, 
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and their counterparts from France, 
Britain and the two Germanys presided over the ceremony. The German and Allied foreign 
ministers are meeting in East Berlin to discuss the status of the city and a 
united Germany's role in world affairs. The ceremony was closed to the public 
but not to the residents of the buildings that line Friedrich Street, which had 
been divided by the Berlin Wall since 1961.  Illa Wobig leaned out her window and 
watched the ceremony unfold just 20 yards below the fourth-floor apartment where 
she has lived for 24 years. ``I saw eight people shot to death on 
that street,'' she said. She said she also saw at least 20 
successful escapes, by tunnel, car and on foot. Baker, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard 
Shevardnadze and the foreign ministers from France, Britain and the two Germanys 
each heralded the end of the checkpoint as a symbol of change. The Soviet Union said today that a 
united Germany can join NATO after a five-year transition period during which 
all Soviet and U.S. troops would leave the country.  The United States rejected the 
proposal, a U.S. official said. The proposal was outlined by Soviet 
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze during international talks in East Berlin 
on the strategic future of a united Germany. A U.S. official, speaking on condition 
of anonymity, said U.S. officials objected to the five-year time limit before 
Germany could join NATO.
