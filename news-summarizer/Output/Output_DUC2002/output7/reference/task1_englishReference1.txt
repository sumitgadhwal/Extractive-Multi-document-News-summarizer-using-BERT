 WHILE Hurricane Andrew was wreaking havoc 
across large parts of southern Florida and Louisiana this week, a grade two 
dollar crisis (on a one-to-four scale, four being most severe) was blowing 
itself out at the end of a tumultuous few days for US and world financial 
markets.  In the Bahamas, government spokesman Mr 
Jimmy Curry said four deaths had been reported on outlying eastern islands.  The hurricane was one of the fiercest in 
the US in decades and the first to hit Miami directly in a quarter of a 
century. In Florida, Andrew caused greatest havoc 
in a largely suburban swathe some 10-15 miles south of Miami.  The town of Homestead, near the centre of 
the storm, was largely flattened, including a local air force base. The government estimated it would cost 
Dollars 20bn-Dollars 30bn to tidy and rebuild in Florida, and to care for 
residents displaced by the storm.  HURRICANE Andrew, claimed to be the 
costliest natural disaster in US history, yesterday smashed its way through the 
state of Louisiana, inflicting severe damage on rural communities but narrowly 
missing the low-lying city of New Orleans.  Government officials in Louisiana, 
Mississippi and Texas yesterday advised or ordered more than 2m people to 
evacuate coastal areas. Louisiana state officials said they had 
no overall count of storm-related injuries but initial estimates reckoned fewer 
than 100. Several of Louisiana's main industries 
were affected, including those of oysters and alligators.  Associated tornadoes devastated Laplace, 
20 miles west of New Orleans. SQUADS of workers fanned out across storm-
battered Louisiana yesterday to begin a massive rebuilding effort after 
Hurricane Andrew had flattened whole districts, killing two people and injuring 
dozens more, agencies report from Florida and New Orleans. Then, however, Andrew lost force as it 
moved north over land.  By yesterday afternoon, it had been down-
graded to tropical storm, in that its sustained windspeeds were below 75 
mph. Across Florida, some 2m people remained 
without electric ity yesterday and health officials were warning the public to 
boil or chemically treat all water.  GENERAL ACCIDENT, the leading British 
insurer, said yesterday that insurance claims arising from Hurricane Andrew 
could 'cost it as much as Dollars 40m'. The brunt of insurance claims from the 
Florida storm will fall on the US industry, and companies with a heavy local 
exposure include the State Farm Group and the Allstate Insurance unit of Sears 
Roebuck.
