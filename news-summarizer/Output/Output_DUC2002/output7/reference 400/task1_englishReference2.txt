 FT 26 AUG 92 / Hurricane damage put at 
Dollars 20bn as 2m people told to leave homes  DAMAGE CAUSED by Hurricane Andrew could 
rise to Dollars 20bn, it was estimated yesterday, as one of the costliest US 
storms this century threatened a further devastating landfall near the city of 
New Orleans. At least three people died on Sunday when 
Hurricane Andrew crossed the Bahamas. The hurricane tore through southern 
Florida early on Monday morning, causing billions of dollars of property damage 
and at least 12 deaths, and yesterday was moving north-west across the Gulf of 
Mexico with winds of about 140 miles an hour. Andrew, the first Caribbean hurricane of 
the season, hit the eastern coast of Florida early yesterday, gusting up to 
165mph.  A million people had been ordered to flee 
their homes in southern Florida as the hurricane moved in from the Bahamas on 
Sunday.  It ripped roofs off houses, smashed cars 
and trucks, snapped power lines and uprooted trees before heading out over the 
Gulf. Across Florida, some 2m people remained 
without electric ity yesterday and health officials were warning the public to 
boil or chemically treat all water.  More than 24 hours after the hurricane, 
some 825,000 households and businesses were still without power.  Official estimates in Miami reported that 
the hurricane had wiped out the homes of one Dade County resident in eight - a 
quarter of a million people. The government estimated it would cost 
Dollars 20bn-Dollars 30bn to tidy and rebuild in Florida, and to care for 
residents displaced by the storm. HURRICANE Andrew, claimed to be the 
costliest natural disaster in US history, yesterday smashed its way through the 
state of Louisiana, inflicting severe damage on rural communities but narrowly 
missing the low-lying city of New Orleans. Then, however, Andrew lost force as it 
moved north over land. By yesterday afternoon, it had been down-
graded to tropical storm, in that its sustained windspeeds were below 75 
mph. Not all damaged property in the area is 
insured and there have been estimates that the storm caused more than Dollars 
20bn of damage. However, local officials in Florida, hit 
earlier in the week by the hurricane, were critical of what they called a delay 
in supplying food, drinking water and other supplies for thousands of people in 
need. Federal emergency officials acknowledged 
distribution problems, Transportation Secretary Andrew Card yesterday promised 
'dramatic' improvements within 24 hours and President George Bush last night 
ordered troops to Florida, without specifying a number.
