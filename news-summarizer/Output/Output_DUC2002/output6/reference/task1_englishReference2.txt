 SAM WALTON was arguably the most 
important retailer of his generation. The church-going son of a farmer born in 
1918 near Kingfisher, Oklahoma, he founded a store chain which made him 
America's richest man, and which, shortly before his death in 1992, became the 
world's biggest retailer.  What they found was a happily married, 
much-liked billionaire who enjoyed quail hunting, breakfasted at the local 
Holiday Inn, and drove a battered pick-up truck, minus two hub-caps. He's ranked as the richest man in the 
nation by a leading business magazine, but to folks in Bentonville, a town of 
about 8,700 people, Sam Walton is just another neighbor. By all accounts, Sam Walton's 
personality permeates operations throughout the company.  Folksy was an understatement.  Paying unexpected calls on stores is 
one way Walton has kept in close touch with everyday goings-on.  His example is followed by other Wal-
Mart executives and most make a point of spending a lot of time in the 
field. To paraphrase Sam's primary rules of 
retailing, ``Rule No.1 is the customer is always right.  Employee satisfaction - an idea which is 
only now gaining wider acceptance in US service industries - was also a vital 
ingredient in the Walton philosophy.  Mr Walton also disproved the 
conventional wisdom that large discount stores could not operate successfully in 
the small, rural towns of the US south. This technology helped Wal-Mart build 
one of the most efficient distribution systems of any retailer.  But perhaps the most fundamental reason 
for its success, the book suggests, has been Wal-Mart's streamlined and highly 
responsive management structure.  Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s Visitors Center 
opens Wednesday in the same building on the downtown square where Walton first 
opened for business on May 9, 1950. The center chronicles the rise of the 
nation's fastest-growing discount chain, using displays and audio-video 
presentations.  MADE IN AMERICA: MY STORY By Sam Walton

personification of the American Dream; few are better qualified for that title

or negative.
