The mass emigration of 
thousands of disaffected East Germans has rekindled reunification talk 
in West Germany, where some legislators plan to begin exploring the 
possiblity of reuniting the two Germanys. 
 Once dismissed as a nostalgic 
daydream, the idea of German reunification has gotten a public nod from 
President Bush and something short of a categorical ``no'' from 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union. 
 It is a prospect that creates 
unease in Britain and France, and in Poland in the East bloc. 
 Reunification, Sorenson says, 
``will pose problems, because we couldn't afford to have a reunited 
Germany outside the Western Alliance. 
The Soviet Union couldn't 
afford to have a reunited Germany as part of the Western Alliance. 
 Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
assured visiting U.S. senators on the eve of a superpower summit that 
West Germany will not forsake NATO to reunite with East Germany, one of 
the senators said Friday. 
 Since East Germans began 
agitating for an end to Communist domination two months ago, public 
pressure has forced the opening of the Berlin Wall and pushed the 
Communists to promise free elections and relinquish their political 
monopoly .  Modrow said the two Germanys 
could work toward confederation in phases with no time limit. 
 Communist leaders launched 
their uphill campaign for March 18 parliamentary elections with a news 
conference to unveil their ``European concept'' that aims for a united 
and demilitarized Europe. 
 Honecker was ousted from the 
leadership on Oct. 18, after massive pro-democracy demonstrations. 
 Earlier Saturday, West German 
Finance Minister Theo Waigel said the East German economy was in a 
``sorrowful state'' and urged the East German government to release 
details on its financial situation. 
 ``The world is expecting a 
Jewish statement on reunification,'' said Edgar Bronfman, the president 
of the World Jewish Congress. 
 As the western German population is now 
aware, German reunification needs a strong, growing west German economy 
to finance the subsidisation of eastern Germans' living standards until 
there is a sustained upswing in the east - even if at the cost of 
higher German inflation than the Bundesbank would wish. 
 West German Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl declared on his return from Moscow on Sunday that "the way is now 
free" for German reunification . 
 Asked how soon the two 
Germanys could merge, Kohl declared that the March election has to come 
first, and "then I think it will all go very quickly" .
