The communist world gets its first 
McDonald's next week, and some people here are wondering whether its American 
hamburgers will be as popular as the local fast-food treat, Pljeskavica. 

John Onoda, a spokesman at McDonald's 
Oak Brook, Ill., headquarters, said it was the first of the chain's outlets in a 
communist country. 

``In fact, this is a clash between the 
Big Mac and Pljeskavica,'' said Vesna Milosevic, an official of Genex, a 
Yugoslav state-run enterprise that has contracted a joint venture agreement with 
McDonald's. 

Thousands of queue-hardened Soviets on 
Wednesday cheerfully lined up to get a taste of ``gamburgers,'' ``chizburgers'' 
and ``Filay-o-feesh'' sandwiches as McDonald's opened in the land of Lenin for 
the first time. 

Under the sign of the golden arches, 
accented by the Soviet hammer-and-sickle flag, hundreds lined up for the long-
awaited grand opening at 10 a.m. on Pushkin Square, reaching out excitedly for 
McDonald's flags and pins as the hamburger chain's army fulfilled the Soviet 
penchant for souvenirs with Western logos. 

 The world's largest McDonald's, with 
27 cash registers and a seating capacity of 900, brings to Moscow not only 
hamburgers, french fries and shakes (called "milk cocktails" here), but also a 
living lesson in Western-style marketing . 

 Soviet farmers, who are supplying most 
of the products, have been given special training and disease-resistant seed for 
potatoes and cucumbers . 

The extra effort was necessary to 
guarantee supplies in a country where as much as 25% of the harvest spoils on 
the way to the consumer . 

 McDonald's hamburgers, fries and 
golden arches came to China on Monday when the fast-food chain opened its first 
restaurant in a nation famed for its distinctive cuisine. 

The 500-seat McDonald's restaurant in 
a three-story building is operated by McDonald's Restaurant Shenzhen Ltd., a 
wholly owned subsidiary of McDonald's Hong Kong. 

 Most of the ingredients used at the 
restaurant are now imported from Hong Kong. 

 But McDonald's executives hope 
eventually to get their supplies of beef and potatoes from China. 

 Seven years after the U.S. hamburger 
giant first tried to bring its Big Macs to South Korea, the golden arches were 
finally going up. 

McAhn Industries Ltd. recently opened 
the first of what it expects will be a string of burger outlets in Seoul. 

McDonald's struggled with the 
government over McAhn's royalty payments to the U.S. partner -- the issue was 
resolved -- and over tight import restrictions on food products.
