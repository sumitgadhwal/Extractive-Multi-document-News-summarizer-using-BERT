 BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) 

 The communist world gets its first 
McDonald's next week, and some people here are wondering whether its American 
hamburgers will be as popular as the local fast-food treat, Pljeskavica. 

Police kept watch on the lines of 
customers snaking around the block, and they regulated the number who came 
inside to avoid overcrowding. 

``I think this restaurant has no 
competition in Belgrade,'' said Milica Danic, a housewife who treated her son to 
a cheeseburger. 

 The next East European McDonald's is 
scheduled to be opened in Budapest, Hungary, by the end of this year, said Vesna 
Milosevic, another Genex official.

 The world's largest version of the 
landmark American fast-food chain rang up 30,000 meals on 27 cash registers, 
breaking the opening-day record for McDonald's worldwide, officials said. 

 The restaurant, built by the company 
in a joint venture with the city of Moscow that began 14 years ago, brought to 
52 the number of countries where McDonald's operates. 

 McDonald's built its own factory, 
including bakery, dairy, meat-processing plant and even potato storage yard, to 
provide its own guaranteed supplies in a country where up to 25 percent of the 
harvest rots en route to the consumer.

 McDonald's hamburgers, fries and 
golden arches came to China on Monday when the fast-food chain opened its first 
restaurant in a nation famed for its distinctive cuisine. 

McDonald's hopes to open a restaurant 
in Beijing later.

Opening the second McDonald's restaurant 
in Moscow, along with a 12-storey office block, Mr George Cohon, head of 
McDonald's Canada, could well be described as the Russian authorities' idea of a 
model investor. 

 Although the first Moscow restaurant is 
the busiest McDonald's in the world the plunging rouble, high inflation and 
constantly changing tax rules have been a challenge to McDonald's management, 
who admitted that they have no idea of when it could recoup its initial Dollars 
50m investment.

Seven years after the U.S. hamburger 
giant first tried to bring its Big Macs to South Korea, the golden arches were 
finally going up. 

The company is a 50-50 joint venture 
of McDonald's Corp., Oak Brook, Ill., and an accountant-turned-entrepreneur, Ahn 
Hyo Young. 

 South Korea may be one of McDonald's 
most promising foreign markets, business analysts say. 
 The competition, besides Wendy's 
International's 11 shops and six of Burger King, a unit of Pillsbury Co., 
includes home-grown burger chains.
