The Quayle family and friends were
celebrating Tuesday afternoon after George Bush announced he wants the
41-year-old Indiana senator to be the Republican nominee for vice
president. 
 Dan Quayle, who grew up in
Huntington, graduated from DePauw University, a small liberal arts college
in Greencastle, Ind., before going to work in the Indiana attorney general's
office in 1970. 
 Dan Quayle has not yet been
nominated for vice president and already Republicans are comparing him to
Thomas Jefferson and John F. Kennedy. 
 Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, who
placed Quayle's name in nomination, stressed his campaign skills and sought
to deflect concerns that he lacked experience for the job. 

 Encumbered by his image as a
political novice who needed a bevy of professional handlers to survive early
campaign controversies, Quayle enters a Bush administration in which he has
few intimates or allies. 

 When asked, Bush employed the
stock lines that Quayle would ``make an outstanding vice president'' and had
been ``tempered by steel'' as he weathered the early furor over his military
service, academic record and personal life. 

Democrats portrayed Quayle during
the campaign as a lightweight, a man with little or no legislative
accomplishments, untested and unqualified to be a heartbeat away from the
presidency. 

 Quayle didn't help his case by
making a number of celebrated gaffes during the campaign, perhaps the worst
being his garbled explanation of the Holocaust and his declaration, ``I
didn't live in this century''. 

 One year after his election, Dan
Quayle has achieved all he ever wanted: He has become dull . 

So when Quayle got to Washington,
he got there with one goal: Support the President and make himself a very
small target. 

Nonetheless, most of
Huntington's 17,000 residents have rallied around their native son for the
exhibition, which tracks his life from infancy through law school, from the
Senate to the vice presidency. 

 Relegated in the campaign to small
towns and safe GOP areas, Quayle as vice president is likely to be given a
traditional ceremonial role _ going to political gatherings and state
funerals _ rather than the advisory role that Walter Mondale and even Bush
had, some scholars feel. 

 Friends said the Quayles are
devoted to their three children and prefer quiet nights at home to nights
out on the town in Washington.
