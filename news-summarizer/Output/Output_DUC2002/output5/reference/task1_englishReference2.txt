 Dan Quayle has not yet been 
nominated for vice president and already Republicans are comparing him 
to Thomas Jefferson and John F. Kennedy. Bush's surprise choice for 
his running mate was supposed to ignite a campaign that has seemed at 
times to suffer from lack of inspiration, but he quickly encountered 
questions over his military record and suggestions he could best serve 
the Republicans by withdrawing from the ticket. Democrats portrayed Quayle 
during the campaign as a lightweight, a man with little or no 
legislative accomplishments, untested and unqualified to be a heartbeat 
away from the presidency.  His every slip, his every 
gaffe, his every goof was news .  Soon, he dropped off the front 
pages.  Relegated in the campaign to 
small towns and safe GOP areas, Quayle as vice president is likely to 
be given a traditional ceremonial role _ going to political gatherings 
and state funerals _ rather than the advisory role that Walter Mondale 
and even Bush had, some scholars feel.  So when Quayle got to 
Washington, he got there with one goal: Support the President and make 
himself a very small target. And Bush's announcement that 
Quayle would be his running mate again was Bush's way of saying: "I 
didn't screw up the first time.  During his entire campaign 
for the vice presidency, Quayle refused all requests from such national 
interview shows. He went on "Meet the Press" 
. The show was uneventful. 
 He is the most important 
person ever to come out of this town, and even as the world considers 
his fitness for the presidency, Huntington is celebrating his life in 
what is ambitiously being billed as the Premiere Dan Quayle Memorabilia 
Exhibit.  Dan Quayle, who grew up in 
Huntington, graduated from DePauw University, a small liberal arts 
college in Greencastle, Ind., before going to work in the Indiana 
attorney general's office in 1970.  Quayle was hired as an entry-
level research assistant by the state Attorney General's office in 1970 
after he returned from six months of basic and advanced training for 
the Indiana National Guard.  Dan and Marilyn Quayle met as 
law students in Indianapolis, married while they were still in school 
and remain close to many of their friends from that period. 
 ``He's already spent 12 years 
as a congressman and senator. The couple, who married in 
1972, have a 14-year-old son, Tucker; a 12-year-old son, Benjamin; and 
a 9-year-old daughter, Corinne. ``He's the same nice guy he 
was in law school''.
