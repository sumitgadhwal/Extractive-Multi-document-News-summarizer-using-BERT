THE BAY AREA QUAKE;

 In the aftermath of the California 
earthquake, President Bush and his aides flew into a whirlwind of earthquake-
related activity yesterday morning.

 Some of it was necessary to get 
federal help flowing to victims, but some seemed designed mostly to project an 
image of a White House in action.

 Gov. George Deukmejian is right to call 
the Legislature into special session within the next two weeks to deal with the 
effects of last Tuesday's Northern California earthquake.

 With Congress already moving to grant 
up to $3 billion in relief, earthquake victims need to know that state officials 
are prepared to come up with the state's share of disaster and reconstruction 
aid as soon as possible, and as soon as is practical.
 Deukmejian should be commended, as 
well, for advising state officials to do all they can to expedite aid to 
earthquake victims without getting too tangled up in red tape .

 The state learns more from every 
earthquake and a critical need now is to learn everything possible from Tuesday, 
Oct. 17 .

 But it is also the time to concentrate 
on helping quake victims through these most trying days of their experience -- 
the period when the emergency response is over and people face the dreary 
details of restoring their life to some kind of normality.

 In the Bay Area, that includes 
hundreds of thousands of commuters who did not suffer personal damage, but face 
massive obstacles in getting to work .

 Roads and bridges in the Bay area 
appear to have suffered some of the most costly damage.

The organization estimated residential 
damages from Tuesday's earthquake at $500 million in the Bay area, with between 
$100 million to $150 million insured.

He is estimating this week's disaster 
will generate insured losses of $2 billion to $4 billion, following about $4 
billion in costs to insurers from Hurricane Hugo .
