 Deaths from heart and blood vessel 
disease dropped 24 percent over the past decade, but it remains by far the 
nation's biggest killer, taking a life every 32 seconds, the American Heart 
Association said Sunday. 
  New treatments that stop a heart attack 
in its tracks may help victims to get out of the hospital more quickly than ever 
before, perhaps even three days after their attacks, a study published today 
concludes. 
  Topol said the early discharges were 
made possible by two recent medical advances _ tissue plasminogen activator, or 
TPA, and angioplasty. 
  A study of more than 22,000 male 
doctors had shown that taking a single aspirin every other day could cut heart 
attack risk in half. 
  An intestinal operation to lower the 
cholesterol of heart attack patients reduced their risk for another heart attack 
or death from heart disease, researchers said today. 
  NEW YORK -- An experiment with more than 1,700 high 
blood pressure patients showed that a blood and urine test can pinpoint those 
patients most likely to have a heart attack. 
 The expensive practice of using balloon 
catheters to force open heart arteries immediately after heart attacks, now 
routinely done at many large hospitals, is unnecessary and should be abandoned, 
according to a major study released Tuesday. 
  The study found that if heart attack 
victims quickly receive clot-dissolving drugs, they usually don't need the extra 
step of the common balloon procedure, known as angioplasty. 
  While calcium blockers may not replace 
beta blockers after heart attacks, the researchers said these drugs still should 
have a role in treatment. 
 Calcium blockers are among several 
classes of medicines commonly prescribed to relieve high blood pressure. 
 A natural substance called transforming 
growth factor beta appears to be able to limit damage to cardiac cells following 
a heart attack, according to a study published in the journal Science. 
  Topol said the early discharges were 
made possible by two recent medical advances _ tissue plasminogen activator, or 
TPA, and angioplasty. 
  The researchers estimated that if 15 
percent of all heart attack patients were discharged after three days, the 
annual saving would be at least $280 million. 
 In July, Stanford University doctors 
found that workers who went back to their jobs about seven weeks after their 
heart attacks did at least as well as workers who went back after a more typical 
convalescence of about 10 or 11 weeks. 
  However, Weisfeldt, who is president-
elect of the heart association, also cautioned that much work remains, both in 
improving care and encouraging people to take better care of their health.
