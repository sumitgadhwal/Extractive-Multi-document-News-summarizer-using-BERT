 Much can be done to prevent heart 
attacks, great improvements are being made in treatments, and recovery is faster 
than ever before.  
  The usual cause 
of heart attacks is a blockage of the coronary arteries, which supply the heart 
muscle with oxygen-rich blood.  
  The 
blockage arises from the buildup of fats, cholesterol and clotted blood. 
  Doctors from the University of 
Michigan Medical Center studied the effects of sending a few carefully selected 
heart patients home early.  
  Topol 
said the early discharges were made possible by two recent medical advances _ 
tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, and angioplasty.  
  When given quickly after a heart attack, TPA can 
dissolve clots in the heart's arteries and minimize damage.  

<s docid="AP880428-0041" num="16" wdcount="14"> Angioplasty can produce similar results 
by opening up the clogged arteries with tiny balloons.  
  Calcium blockers are among several classes of medicines 
commonly prescribed to relieve high blood pressure.  
  Diltiazem is a calcium entry blocker, the newest class of 
drugs to be introduced in the fight against heart disease.  
  The study, conducted in Denmark, found 
that the drug Verapamil, known as a calcium channel blocker, was effective for 
the 1 years after a heart attack.  
  A study of more than 22,000 male doctors had shown that taking a single aspirin 
every other day could cut heart attack risk in half.  
  Aspirin interferes with aspects of the clotting process, 
helping to prevent clot formation in the first place.  
  Nitrates and beta blockers are the other types commonly 
prescribed by doctors.  
  A natural substance called transforming growth factor beta appears to be able to limit 
damage to cardiac cells following a heart attack, according to a study published 
in the journal Science.    Lefer said the TGF beta seems to block the action of other substances, such as tumor 
necrosis factor, that can cause blood vessels to narrow following a heart 
attack.  
 NEW YORK -- An experiment with more 
than 1,700 high blood pressure patients showed that a blood and urine test can 
pinpoint those patients most likely to have a heart attack.  
  The blood portion of the test determines whether the kidneys are 
releasing renin into the blood stream and how active the chemical is.  
  The urine portion of the test tells how much salt is 
in the bloodstream.  
  Early next 
year, the American Heart Association seal of approval will begin appearing on 
foods that are low in fat and cholesterol and therefore can help reduce heart 
disease risk.
