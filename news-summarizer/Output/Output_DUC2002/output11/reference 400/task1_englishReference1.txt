 The Dog Fanciers Club organized the 
event Wednesday to honor Champion Great Elms Prince Charming II, a fluffy little 
Pomeranian, and Nero, a big, amiable bruiser of a German shepherd. Nero specializes in sniffing out bombs 
and narcotics.  The Pomeranian was named best in show 
at the prestigious Westminister Kennel Club Show in Madison Square Garden last 
month.  Taking a break from the headaches of 
the Palestinian uprising and Israel's election campaign, thousands of Israelis 
turned out Saturday for a canine beauty pageant.  About 20,000 people attended the two-
day show, organizers said.  The show briefly pushed the Nov. 1 
general elections out of the limelight for the doglovers. More than 2,500 dogs, representing 138 
breeds, will compete for prizes at Sunday's All Breed Dog Show and Obedience 
Trials at the Los Angeles Sports Arena.  McFadden and his wife, Taffe, run 
their dog handling business in Campbell and do it primarily for the enjoyment 
and satisfaction it brings.  The dogs are frequent winners in 
best of breed and best of show categories.  McFadden's latest product, a Kerry 
blue terrier named Kerrageen's Hotspur, won the best of show prize at the 81st 
Golden Gate Kennel Club Dog Show held Feb. 2-3 at the Cow Palace in San 
Francisco.  It was the 37th best in show win by 
Kerrageen's Hotspur, making him the top Kerry blue terrier of all time.  ON A recent day, the telephone rang 
in the home of William Wegman. The photographer, known for his 
hilarious portraits of his Weimaraners, picked up. "Hello" .  His life with Weimaraners began in 
1970, the year he bought a new video camera and Man Ray, a puppy that cost 
$35. In 1985, he got Fay Ray, who is now 
a familiar face not only among artists but among children who watch "Sesame 
Street."; As a breed, Weimaraners combine "a lap-dog sensibility with a hunting 
capability," the artist said. Such is the life of one German short-
haired pointer, a show dog bearing the name CH.  Robin Crest Lorien Corniche.  The "CH". in his name stands for champion. 
 Basically, his problem comes from 
serving more than one master.  In what is fast becoming a pit-bull 
match, the one owner, Anthony Attalla, is suing the other two, John and Rita 
Remondi, charging that they have been showing Cory even though he is officially 
retired (as announced in Dog News).
