 With no seats and no food for 
the guests of honor, everyone agreed that lunch at Sardi's had gone to 
the dogs. 
 Two dogs, to be specific, the 
city's top police dog and the nation's top show dog. 
 The Dog Fanciers Club 
organized the event Wednesday to honor Champion Great Elms Prince 
Charming II, a fluffy little Pomeranian, and Nero, a big, amiable 
bruiser of a German shepherd. 
 Marco, a feisty boxer owned 
by Dov Amir, padded off with the champion's trophy after beating out 
800 other pretty pooches in Israel's dog-of-the-year contest held in 
Tel Aviv's Exhibition Center. 
 More than 2,500 dogs, 
representing 138 breeds, will compete for prizes at Sunday's All Breed 
Dog Show and Obedience Trials at the Los Angeles Sports Arena. 
 McFadden and his wife, 
Taffe, run their dog handling business in Campbell and do it primarily 
for the enjoyment and satisfaction it brings. 
 "And breeds such as poodles 
have to be highly trimmed."; McFadden said he handles an average of 20 
to 25 dogs at each show and works around 120 shows a year all over the 
U.S. 
 McFadden's latest product, 
a Kerry blue terrier named Kerrageen's Hotspur, won the best of show 
prize at the 81st Golden Gate Kennel Club Dog Show held Feb. 2-3 at the 
Cow Palace in San Francisco. 
It was the 37th best in 
show win by Kerrageen's Hotspur, making him the top Kerry blue terrier 
of all time. 
 ON A recent day, the 
telephone rang in the home of William Wegman. 
The photographer, known for 
his hilarious portraits of his Weimaraners, picked up. "Hello" . 
 In 1985, he got Fay Ray, 
who is now a familiar face not only among artists but among children 
who watch "Sesame Street."; As a breed, Weimaraners combine "a lap-dog 
sensibility with a hunting capability," the artist said. 
Go to court. 
 Such is the life of one 
German short-haired pointer, a show dog bearing the name CH. 
 Robin Crest Lorien 
Corniche. 
The "CH". 
in his name stands for 
champion. 
 He has won 245 show awards 
as Best of Breed and 19 awards as Best in Show. 
In what is fast becoming a 
pit-bull match, the one owner, Anthony Attalla, is suing the other two, 
John and Rita Remondi, charging that they have been showing Cory even 
though he is officially retired (as announced in Dog News). 
For now, a judge's order 
temporarily bars them from further shows.
