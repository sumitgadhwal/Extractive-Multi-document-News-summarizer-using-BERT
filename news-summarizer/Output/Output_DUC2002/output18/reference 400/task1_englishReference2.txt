 Weighing 8 pounds and standing 
13 inches tall, Oscar was created by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios art 
director Cedric Gibbons, who went on to win 11 of the trophies. 
 The Academy holds all the 
rights on the statue and ``reserves the right to buy back an Oscar 
before someone takes it to a pawn shop,'' said Academy spokesman Bob 
Werden. 
  ``Ben-Hur'' in 1959 was the 
most-awarded film with 11, and Walt Disney was the most-awarded person 
with 32 . 
  Oscar's 60-year history is 
filled with examples of the film world's highest achievers being 
overlooked by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. 
  The latest casualties are 
directors James L. Brooks, whose movie ``Broadcast News'' was nominated 
though he wasn't, and Spielberg who was left out in the cold with his 
``Empire of the Sun''. 
  In a lecture and question-and-
answer session Monday, Lee shrugged off the academy's icy treatment of 
his latest movie, ``Do the Right Thing,'' and blamed it on generational 
politics. 
  Oscar selection has come 
under scrutiny as film studios go to new lengths to pull votes out of 
the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. 
  On average, a best picture 
award is worth about $20 million these days. 
  A $500,000 Oscar promotional 
campaign mounted by a studio, therefore, can be a good investment. 
 The Oscar statuette, one of 
the most recognizable images in the entertainment world, has no 
copyright protection, a federal judge has ruled. 
  The decision was a setback 
for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which had sued a 
Chicago-based manufacturer of an employee-incentive trophy similar to 
the Oscar. 
  Spike Lee may have been 
wearing a Georgetown University cap and sweatshirt, but he got a far 
warmer reception from Syracuse University students than he did from 
Academy Award voters. 
  Asked if racism might have 
been involved in the academy nominations, Lee replied, ``Racism's 
involved in everything''. 
  Well, it did turn out to be 
"Rain Man's" evening, but not until the last few minutes, and if there 
was a message in Wednesday night's Academy Awards results, it's that 
parity has returned to Hollywood . 
  As it was, 10 different 
movies split 17 awards, the most winners for one year in this decade 
.
