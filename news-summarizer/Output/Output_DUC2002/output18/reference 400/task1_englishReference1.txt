 The motion picture industry's 
most coveted award, Oscar, was created 60 years ago and 1,816 of the 
statuettes have been produced so far.   Oscar, manufactured by the 
R.S. Owens Co., Chicago, is made of Britannia metal, copper plate, 
nickel plate and gold plate.  Last year, the Oscarcast was 
seen by one billion people in 79 countries.   ``Ben-Hur'' in 1959 was the 
most-awarded film with 11, and Walt Disney was the most-awarded person 
with 32 .  What actress has received the 
most Oscars?  Katharine Hepburn, 4.   Oscar's 60-year history is 
filled with examples of the film world's highest achievers being 
overlooked by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.   The Academy appeared to make 
amends last year by presenting Spielberg with the Irving Thalberg award 
for ``consistently high quality of production''.  In a lecture and question-and-
answer session Monday, Lee shrugged off the academy's icy treatment of 
his latest movie, ``Do the Right Thing,'' and blamed it on generational 
politics.   As it was, 10 different 
movies split 17 awards, the most winners for one year in this 
decade.   The industry is still 
adjusting to its changing -- its older and more demanding audience -- 
and that means a wider variety of films.   Nominations for acting, 
directing, art direction and all specialized categories are handled by 
select branches and committees composed of Academy members.  All voting members of the 
Academy can participate in the best picture nominations and may vote 
for the final awards in all categories.   Given the tremendous impact 
both an Oscar nomination and an Oscar victory have on a film's 
fortunes, it's not entirely surprising that a certain degree of 
artifice might surround the Oscars.   The Academy insists that a 
contract signed by Oscar winners mandates that they will not sell the 
trophies without first offering them to the Academy for a nominal 
fee.   ``But now that the word is 
out that these awards are worth $10,000 to $50,000, people are 
reluctant to sell them back to the Academy for $10,'' Willits said.   The academy claimed that the 
Star Award, the trophy look-alike made by Creative House Promotions, 
violated copyright laws, diluted the academy's trademark and 
represented unfair competition.  The court found otherwise.   The Walt Disney Co. filed suit 
in Los Angeles federal court Thursday against the Academy of Motion 
Picture Arts and Sciences, charging copyright infringement of its Snow 
White character and unfair competition .
