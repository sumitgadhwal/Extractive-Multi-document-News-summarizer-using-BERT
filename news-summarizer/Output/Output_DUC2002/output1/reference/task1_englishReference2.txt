Tropical Storm Gilbert formed in the 
eastern Caribbean and strengthened into a hurricane Saturday night.
 The weather service issued a flash 
flood watch for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands until at least 6 p.m. 
Sunday.
Forecasters said the hurricane was 
gaining strength as it passed over the ocean and would dump heavy rain on the 
Dominican Republic and Haiti as it moved south of Hispaniola, the Caribbean 
island they share, and headed west.
Officials in the Dominican Republic, 
sideswiped Sunday by the storm, reported five dead.
Hurricane Gilbert slammed into Kingston 
on Monday with torrential rains and 115 mph winds that ripped roofs off homes 
and buildings, uprooted trees and downed power lines.
Forecasters say Gilbert was expected 
to lash Jamaica throughout the day and was on track to later strike the Cayman 
Islands, a small British dependency northwest of Jamaica.
The storm killed 19 people in Jamaica 
and five in the Dominican Republic before moving west to Mexico.
 The Jamaican Embassy reported earlier 
that 500,000 of the nation's 2.3 million people were homeless.
Seaga said Jamaica would need $8 
billion in aid.
Gilbert also buffeted the Cayman 
Islands, but no deaths were reported .
``All interests in the Western 
Caribbean should continue to monitor the progress of this dangerous hurricane,'' 
the service advised.
Hurricane Gilbert, one of the 
strongest storms ever, slammed into the Yucatan Peninsula Wednesday and leveled 
thatched homes, tore off roofs, uprooted trees and cut off the Caribbean resorts 
of Cancun and Cozumel.
The eye of the storm passed over 
Cozumel and Cancun with howling winds clocked at 160 mph at about 8 a.m. 
EDT.
Looters roamed the streets of Cancun, 
stealing from stores whose windows were blown away.
The storm was about 550 miles 
southeast of Brownsville, Texas, the center said in a statement.
The National Hurricane Center said 
Gilbert was the most intense storm on record in terms of barometric 
pressure.
Earlier Wednesday Gilbert was 
classified as a Category 5 storm, the strongest ad deadliest type of 
hurricane.
 Only two Category 5 hurricanes have 
hit the United States _ the 1935 storm that killed 408 people in Florida and 
Hurricane Camille that devastated the Mississippi coast in 1969, killing 256 
people.
Hurricane Gilbert's growth from a 
harmless low pressure zone off Africa to a ferocious killer in the Gulf of 
Mexico was fueled by a combination of heat, moisture and wind that baffles 
forecasters.
