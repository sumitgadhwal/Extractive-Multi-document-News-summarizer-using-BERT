 Tropical Storm Gilbert formed in the 
eastern Caribbean and strengthened into a hurricane Saturday night.
 Why Gilbert organized and strengthened 
while other systems didn't ``is a mystery more or less,'' said University of 
Miami meteorology Professor Rainer Bleck.
Gilbert reached Jamaica after skirting 
southern Puerto Rico, Haiti and the Dominican Republic.
 Hurricane warnings were issued Monday 
for the south coast of Cuba east of Camaguey, the Cayman Islands, and Haiti, 
while warnings were discontinued for the Dominican Republic.
Sheets said Gilbert was expected next 
to sweep over the Cayman Islands, on its westward track, and in two to three 
days veer northwest into the southern Gulf of Mexico.
 Earlier Wednesday Gilbert was 
classified as a Category 5 storm, the strongest ad deadliest type of 
hurricane.
 Such storms have maximum sustained 
winds greater than 155 mph and can cause catastrophic damage.
Hurricane Gilbert, one of the 
strongest storms ever, slammed into the Yucatan Peninsula Wednesday and leveled 
thatched homes, tore off roofs, uprooted trees and cut off the Caribbean resorts 
of Cancun and Cozumel.
 The Mexican National Weather Service 
reported winds gusting as high as 218 mph earlier Wednesday with sustained winds 
of 179 mph.
 More than 120,000 people on the 
northeast Yucatan coast were evacuated, the Yucatan state government said.
 Shelters had little or no food, water 
or blankets and power was out.
The eye of the storm passed over 
Cozumel and Cancun with howling winds clocked at 160 mph at about 8 a.m. 
The storm killed 19 people in Jamaica 
and five in the Dominican Republic before moving west to Mexico.
 Prime Minister Edward Seaga of Jamaica 
said Wednesday the storm destroyed an estimated 100,000 of Jamaica's 500,000 
homes when it throttled the island Monday.
The Jamaican Embassy reported earlier 
that 500,000 of the nation's 2.3 million people were homeless.
The National Hurricane Center said a 
hurricane watch was in effect on the Texas coast from Brownsville to Port Arthur 
and along the coast of northeast Mexico from Tampico north.
Only two Category 5 hurricanes have 
hit the United States _ the 1935 storm that killed 408 people in Florida and 
Hurricane Camille that devastated the Mississippi coast in 1969, killing 256 
people.
 The National Hurricane Center said 
Gilbert was the most intense storm on record in terms of barometric 
pressure.
 It was measured at 26.31 inches, 
breaking the 26.35 inches recorded for the 1935 hurricane that devastated the 
Florida Keys.
