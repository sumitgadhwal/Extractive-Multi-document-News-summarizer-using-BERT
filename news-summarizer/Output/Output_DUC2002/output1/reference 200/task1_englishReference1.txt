Tropical Storm Gilbert formed in the 
eastern Caribbean and strengthened into a hurricane Saturday night.
Gilbert reached Jamaica after skirting 
southern Puerto Rico, Haiti and the Dominican Republic.
Hurricane Gilbert, one of the 
strongest storms ever, slammed into the Yucatan Peninsula Wednesday and leveled 
thatched homes, tore off roofs, uprooted trees and cut off the Caribbean resorts 
of Cancun and Cozumel.
The Mexican National Weather Service 
reported winds gusting as high as 218 mph earlier Wednesday with sustained winds 
of 179 mph.
More than 120,000 people on the 
northeast Yucatan coast were evacuated, the Yucatan state government said.
Shelters had little or no food, water 
or blankets and power was out.
The storm killed 19 people in Jamaica 
and five in the Dominican Republic before moving west to Mexico.
Prime Minister Edward Seaga of Jamaica 
said Wednesday the storm destroyed an estimated 100,000 of Jamaica's 500,000 
homes when it throttled the island Monday.
The National Hurricane Center said a 
hurricane watch was in effect on the Texas coast from Brownsville to Port Arthur 
and along the coast of northeast Mexico from Tampico north.
The National Hurricane Center said 
Gilbert was the most intense storm on record in terms of barometric 
pressure.
