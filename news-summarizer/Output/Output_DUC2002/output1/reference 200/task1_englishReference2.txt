Tropical Storm Gilbert formed in the 
eastern Caribbean and strengthened into a hurricane Saturday night.
Hurricane Gilbert slammed into Kingston 
on Monday with torrential rains and 115 mph winds that ripped roofs off homes 
and buildings, uprooted trees and downed power lines.
The storm killed 19 people in Jamaica 
and five in the Dominican Republic before moving west to Mexico.
 The Jamaican Embassy reported earlier 
that 500,000 of the nation's 2.3 million people were homeless.
Gilbert also buffeted the Cayman 
Islands, but no deaths were reported .
 Hurricane Gilbert, one of the 
strongest storms ever, slammed into the Yucatan Peninsula Wednesday and leveled 
thatched homes, tore off roofs, uprooted trees and cut off the Caribbean resorts 
of Cancun and Cozumel.
The storm was about 550 miles 
southeast of Brownsville, Texas, the center said in a statement.
The National Hurricane Center said 
Gilbert was the most intense storm on record in terms of barometric 
pressure.
 Earlier Wednesday Gilbert was 
classified as a Category 5 storm, the strongest ad deadliest type of 
hurricane.
Hurricane Gilbert's growth from a 
harmless low pressure zone off Africa to a ferocious killer in the Gulf of 
Mexico was fueled by a combination of heat, moisture and wind that baffles 
forecasters.
