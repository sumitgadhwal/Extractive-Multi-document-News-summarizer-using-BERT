The National Hurricane Center said a hurricane watch was in
effect on the Texas coast from Brownsville to Port Arthur and along
the coast of northeast Mexico from Tampico north.``Right now it's actually moving over Jamaica,'' said Bob
Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami.The spokesman said earlier in the day, Guantanamo had moved to
``Condition Two,'' meaning electrical power usage was cut back to
only essential uses and ``all non-essential personnel sent to their
barracks.''``If that happens in an area where there's plenty of moisture in
the lower atmosphere (the bottom 10,000 feet or so), this
convergence may lead to upward motion and cloud formation,'' Bleck
said.``It looks like the eye is going to move lengthwise across that
island, and they're going to bear the full brunt of this powerful
hurricane,'' he said.Prime Minister Edward Seaga of Jamaica alerted all government
agencies, saying Sunday night: ``Hurricane Gilbert appears to be a
real threat and everyone should follow the instructions and
hurricane precautions issued by the Office of Disaster Preparedness
in order to minimize the danger.''By Wednesday night the National Hurricane Center downgraded it
to a Category 4, but center director Bob Sheets said:``There's no
question it'll strengthen again once it comes off the Yucatan
Peninsula and gets back in open water.''The National Hurricane Center said Gilbert was the most intense
storm on record in terms of barometric pressure.Hurricane Gilbert's growth from a harmless low
pressure zone off Africa to a ferocious killer in the Gulf of
Mexico was fueled by a combination of heat, moisture and wind that
baffles forecasters.Sheets said Gilbert was expected next to sweep over the Cayman
Islands, on its westward track, and in two to three days veer
northwest into the southern Gulf of Mexico.Honeymooner Sheila Fournier of Long Island said she and her
husband, Pete, had been evacuated from the Villas Playa Hotel.The hurricane was moving west at about 15 mph and was expected to continue this motion for the next 24 hours.On Saturday, Hurricane Florence was downgraded to a tropical
storm and its remnants pushed inland from the U.S. Gulf Coast.Hurricane Gilbert swept toward Jamaica yesterday with 100-mile-an-hour winds, and officials issued warnings to residents on the southern coasts of the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Cuba.In Washington, the Navy reported its bases at Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba, and Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, had taken various
precautionary steps but appeared to be safe from the brunt of the
hurricane.
