 A major earthquake rocked 
northern California Tuesday evening, collapsing part of the San 
Francisco Bay Bridge and shaking Candlestick Park and buildings up to 
95 miles away.  The quake was felt as far 
away as Reno, Nev., 225 miles to the northeast.   It was not immediately clear 
how extensive the damage was from the quake, which struck at 5:04 p.m. 
PDT and registered 6.9 on the Richter scale.   It was centered near 
Hollister, 80 miles southeast of San Francisco in San Benito 
County.   The San Francisco earthquake 
of 1906, which occurred before the Richter scale was devised, has been 
estimated at 8.3 on the Richter scale.  Fans at Candlestick screamed 
as the stadium swayed shortly before the San Francisco Giants and 
Oakland Athletics were to have begun the third game of the World 
Series.   Televised footage of the 
bridge showed that a 30-foot section of the span's upper deck had 
collapsed onto the bottom level.   San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos 
has estimated damage $2 billion in his city alone.   1 -- Major fires hit Marina 
District   "The buildings that collapsed 
did so because of a combination of two things: very poor soil and very 
poor structural design," said Peter I. Yanev, chairman of EQE 
Engineering Inc., a structural engineering firm in San Francisco .   "What collapsed and killed 
some people were four-story apartment buildings that had garages built 
all the way along the bottom (floor)," Yanev said.   Jay Cahill, an owner of 
Cahill Construction Co., a contractor that built several high-rises in 
the city, said the earthquake codes "did their job".   Ever since the 1906 earthquake 
devastated San Francisco, many scientists have believed the next ``big 
one'' would strike the Los Angeles end of the mighty San Andreas 
Fault.  SCIENTISTS LAST YEAR HAD 
PINPOINTED TUESDAY'S SITE AS LIKELY TO BE JOLTED   Thomas Heaton, the Geological 
Survey scientist in charge of the agency's Pasadena field office, said 
that the 1987 and 1988 earthquakes now must be seen as "preshocks" of 
the Tuesday's 6.9 temblor.  Private groups and officials 
from Tokyo to London to Charleston, S.C., offered help to the ruptured 
San Francisco Bay area, but some said relief for the earthquake could 
drain coffers already strained by previous disasters.  President Bush directed $273 
million in immediate aid for quake victims and said he would visit the 
area Friday or Saturday.  Although they are a continent 
apart, the cities of Charleston, S.C., and San Francisco now share a 
fateful page in the ledger of time.
