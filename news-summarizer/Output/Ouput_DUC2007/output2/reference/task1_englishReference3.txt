After a long morning of drills in reading, third-graders at Public School 156 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, spent an hour last Friday dancing to the urgent flutter of flamenco music. Dance is an indispensable part of the curriculum for all 750 students at Public School 156, along with music, art and creative writing. For the last two decades, schools like Public School 156 have increasingly turned to the city's museums, concert halls and theaters for lessons in art, music and dance. Even though the city is investing in arts education again, the institutions are playing a greater role than ever, not just giving occasional performances or tours as they once did, but helping schools retool their curriculums to integrate art, music and dance into every academic subject. While Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Chancellor Rudy Crew have goaded schools to focus on reading and math, they have also increased the arts education budget by $150 million since 1997, providing about 1,000 art and music teachers and supplies for the city's 1,100 public schools. Early next year, under the leadership of David Kapell, the mayor of Greenport since 1994, a new program will bring classical music to the 600 students in the town's single public school.
