A school in the western part of east China's Fujian Province has been set up to provide more qualified professionals, and sports, arts, and music teachers for primary and middle schools in rural areas. Delaine Easton, the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, has called for the restoration of arts education in California public schools. At present the challenge is to get art back into the schools. The nonprofit foundation is dedicated to restoring music programs in schools nationwide and raising public awareness about the importance of music education. Last June, saying that without adequate funding, the arts can't flourish, the task force asked the city to establish a $200 million public endowment for the arts, raising roughly $15.5 million per year for 10 years, eventually going to fund the Seattle Arts Commission. For the last two decades, schools like Public School 156 have increasingly turned to the city's museums, concert halls and theaters for lessons in art, music and dance. Carnegie Hall spends close to $1 million a year training teachers to use music in the classroom, putting on concerts for school children and sending musicians to 22 schools across the city for seven visits per class over a school year. Giuliani and Chancellor Rudy Crew have goaded schools to focus on reading and math, they have also increased the arts education budget by $150 million since 1997, providing about 1,000 art and music teachers and supplies for the city's 1,100 public schools.
