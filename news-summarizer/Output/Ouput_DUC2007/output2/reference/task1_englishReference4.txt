Giuliani and Chancellor Rudy Crew have goaded schools to focus on reading and math, they [Guiliani and Crew] have also increased the arts education budget by $150 million since 1997, providing about 1,000 art and music teachers and supplies for the city's 1,100 public schools.  

With a $100,000 three-year grant, provided by Texaco and the Eastman School of Music through their Partnership Opportunities program, the district recently extended its program to prekindergarten students.
