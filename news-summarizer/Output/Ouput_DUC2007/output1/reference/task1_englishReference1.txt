The Southern Poverty Law Center, which was founded in the 1970s to battle racial bias, won major legal fights against the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist groups. Since co-founding the Southern Poverty Law Center in 1971, Dees has wielded the civil lawsuit like a buck knife, carving financial assets out of hate group leaders who inspire followers to beat, burn and kill. The Southern Poverty Law Center represented the predominantly black Macedonia Baptist Church in Clarendon County, which won a $215 million judgment against the Christian Knights and Klan members after the church was burned four years ago. The number of organized hate groups in the United States grew last year, mostly through new chapters of established white power organizations, the Southern Poverty Law Center said in a report released Tuesday. Dees sent Triggs and Mayor Charles Dobbelaire, 59, a copy of the center's publication ``Ten Ways to Fight Hate,'' and advised East Peoria city leaders to do two things: Speak out immediately and form a broad-based coalition on race issues. Carrier said the Southern Poverty Law Center will distribute a million free copies of the booklet and a companion, ``Responding to Hate at School'' The booklets will go to every school principal, mayor and police chief in the nation, as well as to human rights groups, religious leaders and interested citizens. The Southern Poverty Law Center previously recorded a 20-percent increase in hate groups from 1996 to 1997.
