Over the last two decades, the Southern Poverty Law Center has taken the Ku Klux Klan and other hate groups to court, starting with a successful suit against the Invisible Empire Klan, which in 1979 attacked a group of peaceful civil rights marchers in Decatur, Ala.  But putting a hate group out of business isn't easy: While [Morris Dees] has won significant civil judgments against the Ku Klux Klan and the White Aryan Resistance, the groups have survived.

In a lawsuit that goes to trial Monday, attorney Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center is representing a mother and son who were attacked by security guards for the white supremacist group [Aryan Nations].  Morris Dees, co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., represented the Keenans and has said he intends to take everything the Aryan Nations owns to pay the judgment, including the sect's name.  Morris Dees, the civil rights lawyer who led the plaintiffs' legal team, has said he expected the judgment to bring a quick end to the Aryan Nations and its racist, anti-Semitic message.  

The Southern Poverty Law Center is suing Butler, hoping to bankrupt him [Richard Girnt Butler] in a lawsuit for unspecified civil damages filed in Coeur d'Alene in January.

The Southern Poverty Law Center represented the predominantly black Macedonia Baptist Church in Clarendon County, which won a $21.5 million judgment against the Christian Knights and Klan members after the church was burned four years ago.
