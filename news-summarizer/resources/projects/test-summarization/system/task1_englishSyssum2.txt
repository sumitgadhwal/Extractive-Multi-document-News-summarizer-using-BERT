The Honduran 
president closed schools and public offices on the coast Monday and 
ordered all air force planes and helicopters to evacuate people from 
the Islas de la Bahia, a string of small islands off the country's 
central coast.
Maria 
Gonzalez said she needed the gas to cook with when her firewood gets 
wet.
That meant the Honduran coast had been under hurricane 
conditions for more than a day.
``It's been horrible,'' 
said Montgomery, as she and her friend drank cocktails at an outdoor 
restaurant.
At least 231 people have been confirmed dead in Honduras from former-hurricane 
Mitch, bringing the storm's death toll in the region to 357, the National 
Emergency Commission said Saturday.
That is in addition to least another 600 people elsewhere in the country, 
Bolanos said.
As of 
Thursday, Mitch had killed 6,076 people in Honduras _ down from officials' 
earlier estimate of 7,000.
Honduran authorities still don't know how many shelters 
have been set up across the Central American country.
The estimated 
number of homeless dropped from 580,000 to 569,000 Thursday.
``We have to vaccinate the children,'' said 
Dr. Mario Soto, who has treated at least 300 children at the shelter 
for diarrhea, conjunctivitis and bacterial infections.
