The Honduran 
president closed schools and public offices on the coast Monday and 
ordered all air force planes and helicopters to evacuate people from 
the Islas de la Bahia, a string of small islands off the country's 
central coast.
As of 
Thursday, Mitch had killed 6,076 people in Honduras _ down from officials' 
earlier estimate of 7,000.
That is in addition to least another 600 people elsewhere in the country, 
Bolanos said.
At least 231 people have been confirmed dead in Honduras from former-hurricane 
Mitch, bringing the storm's death toll in the region to 357, the National 
Emergency Commission said Saturday.
Honduran authorities still don't know how many shelters 
have been set up across the Central American country.
