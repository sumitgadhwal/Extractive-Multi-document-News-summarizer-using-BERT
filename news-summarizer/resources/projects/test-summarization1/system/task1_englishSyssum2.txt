``Only those who want to prolong the anarchy and instability 
prevent efforts to set up a new government,'' Hun Sen said in a televised 
speech marking the anniversary of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords.
Negotiations to form the next government have become deadlocked, 
and opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy 
are out of the country following threats of arrest from strongman 
Hun Sen. Hun Sen complained Monday that the opposition was trying 
to make its members' return an international issue.
Sam Rainsy and the 14 members of parliament 
from his party have been holed up overseas for two months.
Worried that party colleagues still face arrest for their politics, 
opposition leader Sam Rainsy sought further clarification Friday of 
security guarantees promised by strongman Hun Sen. Sam Rainsy wrote 
in a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk that he was eager to attend the 
first session of the new National Assembly on Nov. 25, but complained 
that Hun Sen's assurances were not strong enough to ease concerns 
his party members may be arrested upon their return to Cambodia.
Sam Rainsy, who earlier called Hun Sen's 
statement ``full of loopholes,'' asked Sihanouk for his help in obtaining 
a promise from Hun Sen that all members of the Sam Rainsy Party were 
free from prosecution for their political activities during and after 
last July's election.
