Negotiations to form the next government have become deadlocked, 
and opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy 
are out of the country following threats of arrest from strongman 
Hun Sen. Hun Sen complained Monday that the opposition was trying 
to make its members' return an international issue.
Sam Rainsy, who earlier called Hun Sen's 
statement ``full of loopholes,'' asked Sihanouk for his help in obtaining 
a promise from Hun Sen that all members of the Sam Rainsy Party were 
free from prosecution for their political activities during and after 
last July's election.
Sam Rainsy and the 14 members of parliament 
from his party have been holed up overseas for two months.
